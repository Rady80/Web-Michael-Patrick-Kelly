        I remember the night in the heat of July<br>
        we were strangers<br>
        After the thunder cried, the lightning was kind of amazing<br>
        I got lost in your glow, felt so high even though I was sober<br>
        You had a reckless style and your smile was rarer than gold dust<br>
        <br>
        The way we hold on, it's a miracle<br>
        This is a love song forever in the makin'<br>
        <br>
        Oh, the years go by<br>
        But you still light up, light up my heart<br>
        Oh, you know time flies<br>
        But you still light up, light up my dark<br>
        It's been the wildest dream, a masterpiece<br>
        Let's ride around the sun<br>
        Darlin', after all this time, you're still the one<br>
        <br>
        People come, people go, nothin' lasts anymore, it's a strange world<br>
        But dreaming side by side, I wake up believin' in angels<br>
        Yeah, you know the way the sparks still fly, how you read my mind, it's electric<br>
        And when I leave this life, I'll know loving you was always the best bit<br>
        <br>
        The way we hold on, it's a miracle<br>
        This is a love song forever in the makin'<br>

        Oh, the years go by<br>
        But you still light up, light up my heart<br>
        Oh, you know time flies<br>
        But you still light up, light up my dark<br>
        It's been the wildest dream, a masterpiece<br>
        Let's ride around the sun<br>
        Darling, after all this time, you're still the one<br>
        Still the one<br>
        It's been the wildest dream, a masterpiece<br>
        Let's ride around the sun<br>

      You tell me you‘re ok but your<br />
      Voice don‘t match the words you said<br />
      I hate that you‘re pushing me away<br />
      Fighting so hard to take a breath<br />
      So<br />
      <br />
      Oh love, when the river runs dry<br />
      It‘s hard to see through blurry eyes<br />
      Don‘t say you‘re not strong enough<br />
      To let me love you<br />
      Just the way you are<br />
      <br />

      To let me love you<br />
      Just the way you are<br />
      <br />

      Hiding all I wanna see<br />
      The silence in the air we breathe<br />
      Echoing so hopelessly<br />
      <br />
      I called you yesterday and your voice<br />
      Didn‘t match the words you said<br />

      I hope you‘ll know<br />

    Just a kid walking home through a field of dust<br />
    Trying to pick you some flowers where the grains rust<br />
    Past the house on the street where we used to play<br />
    I‘m gonna make up, gonna make up<br />
    For what I forgot to say<br />
    <br />
    Somehow I‘ll get them roses<br />
    Daisies and daffodils too<br />
    But since I don’t have a coin in my pocket<br />
    I’ll just steal them for you<br />
    <br />
    I want you to know after all these years<br />
    The highs and the lows, all the joys and tears<br />
    Your love still weighs and I’ll find a way<br />
    To get you flowers on mother’s day<br />
    <br />
    I want you to know and see who I’ve become<br />
    The care that you showed has kept me warm<br />
    Your love still weighs and I’ll find a way<br />
    To get you flowers on mother’s day<br />
    <br />
    Lalalalalala lalalalala - flowers, flowers<br />
    Your love still weighs and I’ll find a way<br />
    To get you flowers on mother’s day<br />
    <br />
    The day you left, I was five and I didn’t know <br />
    That you were heading to a place that I couldn’t go<br />
    And now I’m driving back to the town where we used to stay<br />
    I gathered a bunch, gathered a bunch<br />
    And now I can afford to pay<br />
    <br />
    Some say “never say never”<br />
    But “You don’t know what you’ve got ‘til it’s gone”<br />
    Cuz I feel like I’m that kid forever<br />
    A kid just missing his mom<br />
    <br />
    I want you to know after all these years<br />
    The highs and the lows, all the joys and tears<br />
    Your love still weighs and I’ll find a way<br />
    To get you flowers on mother’s day<br />
    <br />
    I want you to know and see who I’ve become<br />
    The care that you showed has kept me warm<br />

    Lalalalalala lalalalala - flowers, flowers<br />
    Your love still weighs and I’ll find a way<br />
    To get you flowers on mother’s day<br />
    <br />
    I‘m coming back home to try to right some wrongs<br />
    And all of these flowers soon will be gone<br />
    Oh I know that I am not forever young<br />
    But I’m still the kid just missing his mom<br />
    <br />
    I want you to know after all these years<br />
    The highs and the lows, all the joys and tears<br />
    Your love still weighs and I’ll find a way<br />

    I still see green<br />
    I still see the sun breaking through the clouds<br />
    And I still breathe<br />
    Even though it seems we´re about to drown<br />
    And maybe we’ve lost our ways over time<br />
    But if we stick together, we might get this right<br />
    I still dream<br />
    Cause I know there is hope for us<br />
    <br />
    Oh, what the world needs now is love<br />
    Let’s make it rain down from above<br />
    Cause in the end it’s all we got<br />
    Oh, what the world needs now is love<br />
    Huuu huuu huuu huuu<br />
    <br />
    I still see blue<br />
    I still see the river run to the sea<br />
    And when I see you<br />
    That’s how I know that I still believe<br />
    And I get on my knees and I pray every day<br />
    If love is the answer, then we’ll be okay<br />
    I still dream<br />
    Cause I know there is hope for us<br />

    Touching ground on Ellis Island<br />
    Searching for the promised land<br />
    Am I a legal alien coming home?<br />
    <br />
    50 steps to win my freedom<br />
    Pushing to the golden fever<br />
    Running through your maze of steel and stone<br />
    <br />
    Somewhere between your stars and stripes<br />
    I think I can see dawn’s early light<br />
    Where is the love? Now let it rise, let it rise<br />
    <br />
    America, America<br />
    Wake up, wake up, wake up<br />
    All your hopes and dreams<br />
    America, America<br />
    Stand up, stand up, stand up<br />
    For what you believe<br />
    <br />
    Tell me, will you keep your promise?<br />
    I have come to find the solace<br />
    Glowing in your flame of liberty<br />
    <br />
    Even though you got your demons<br />
    In the end, your better angels<br />
    Always change the course of history<br />
    <br />
    Somewhere between your stars and stripes<br />
    I still can see dawn’s early light<br />
    Where is the love? Now let it rise, let it rise<br />
    <br />
    America, America<br />
    Wake up, wake up, wake up<br />
    All your hopes and dreams<br />
    America, America<br />
    Stand up, stand up, stand up<br />
    For what you believe<br />

    Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh<br />
    Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh<br />
    Wake up, wake up, wake up<br />
    All your hopes and dreams<br />
    <br />
    Somewhere between your stars and stripes<br />
    I still can see dawn’s early light<br />
    Bring back the love, now let it rise, let it rise<br />

    America, America<br />
    Wake up, wake up, wake up<br />
    All your hopes and dreams<br />

    You keep blowing my mind<br />
    Keep blowing my mind<br />
    Now I’m no longer the same<br />
    And you are to blame<br />
    <br />
    I could sing you a song<br />
    I could sing you a song<br />
    Could write a poem for you<br />

    Sometimes it feels like you’ve got no one by your side<br />
    A heart of steel, you know you need it to survive<br />
    Behind the bars, you never see the light of day<br />
    No shooting star, does anybody hear you pray?<br />
    <br />
    Waiting for the time to carve the outline of new you<br />
    Waiting for the sign to better everything about you, about you<br />

    You’re the only one who caught my eye<br />
    You, you are an Icon<br />
    You’re just waiting for the paint to dry<br />
    <br />
    Broken mirrors putting scars upon your face<br />
    Amongst ancient pillars judges will review your case<br />
    <br />
    Waving off the crime, you’ll carve the outline of new you<br />
    Weighing every dime you paid for your past that was due, that was due<br />
    <br />
    Now you, you are an Icon<br />
    You’re the only one who caught my eye<br />
    You, you are an Icon<br />
    You’re just waiting for the paint to dry<br />

    Hit me up, into grace<br />
    I’m taken all night and day<br />
    By tidal waves<br />
    Clearing all my riddles and doubts<br />
    Knock ‘em down, knock ‘em out<br />
    There’s no more livin’ without<br />
    <br />
    Oh your love is divine<br />
    Like a light that’s never fading<br />
    Knocks me out every time<br />
    And I like the way it’s shaking me up<br />
    O K.O K.O K.O K.O K.O K.O K.O K.O K.<br />

    I could use a little conversation<br />
    Cuz my heart has been caught in isolation<br />
    A little light in the dark could be <br />
    the spark of a new life<br />
    <br />
    I see you bouncin’ through the lousy weather<br />
    You shake it off, you keep it all together<br />
    But every time when you’re gone<br />
    I can’t wait for the dawn<br />
    You bring the good life<br />
    <br />
    And I say,<br />
    What up, what up, what up<br />
    We gotta live, we gotta love<br />
    What up, what up, what up<br />
    It’s time you show up<br />
    <br />
    Good morning sunshine<br />
    Good to see you again<br />
    Cuz the world ain't pretty<br />
    when you're not in the city<br />
    And I don't have a friend<br />
    <br />
    Good morning sunshine<br />
    When I hold your hand<br />
    It's for worse or for better<br />
    We will both stick together<br />
    Won't change ‘til the end<br />

    Now let me see your light, light, shine on me<br />
    Let me see your light, light, shine on me<br />

    I could really use a long vacation<br />
    Your heat waves are my medication<br />
    You know you tickle my skin<br />
    When I take you in, I’m feelin’ alright<br />
    <br />
    You got me bouncin’ through the lousy weather<br />
    My clouded heart knows it won't last forever<br />
    Cuz every time when you´re gone<br />
    I just wait for the dawn<br />
    You bring the good life<br />
    <br />

    Have I been too hard for you, love?<br />
    Is this it, have you had enough?<br />
    How come you stayed, why not run?<br />

    Do you ever doubt it was wrong?<br />
    What a heavyweight you took on<br />
    Now, look at all the damage that’s done<br />
    <br />
    God knows if I can fix it now<br />
    If we can figure this out somehow<br />
    I know, I’ve had my head in the sand<br />
    Now I’m taking the stand on trial<br />
    <br />
    We swore la-la-love for better or worse<br />
    Now I’m here trying to find those words<br />
    La-la-love, when sorry ain’t good enough<br />
    <br />
    With the benefit of hindsight and time<br />
    Now it’s obvious and clear I was blind<br />
    And I was caught up in no man’s land<br />
    <br />
    I could try, and reach for the truth<br />
    I could write a play or a book<br />
    But maybe all you need is<br />
    for me to hold your hand<br />

    La-la-love for better or worse<br />
    Like a little boy who’s lost his words<br />

    I got a hold and I won't let go of it again, no I'm not looking back<br />
    We had our reasons for losing touch<br />

    Come down to the rocks where we<br />
    Would bathe in the rivers arms<br />
    Come down we can talk, we can talk like<br />

    When we were young<br />
    When we were young<br />
    There was a light upon every one<br />

    I got a feeling inside it's never going away<br />
    The future is coming back<br />
    I'm in a movie where everybody is frozen in time<br />
    And gettin' ready to dance<br />
    <br />
    Come down to the rocks where we<br />

    Come down we can talk<br />
    We can taaaalk like<br />

    Gold, I'm waiting for a golden age<br />
    Gold, take me to a golden age<br />
    Gold, we should talk like<br />

    And give me a new heart and a new spirit<br />
    Oh, You take no pleasure in the death of anyone<br />
    <br />
    Come from the four winds, breath<br />
    Breathe on these dead<br />
    <br />
    So that they come to life<br />
    So that they come to life<br />
    So that they come to life<br />
    So that they come to life<br />

    So that they come to life<br />
    So that they come to life<br />
    So that they come to life<br />

    I’ve been thinking 'bout the dark<br />
    soul of Rock 'n' Roll<br />
    'bout the loss, about the heavy toll<br />
    Voices of angels<br />
    Are suddenly just gone<br />
    Life can be short<br />
    But melody lives on<br />
    <br />
    So I sing a<br />
    Requiem and a Halle Hallelujah<br />
    A requiem and a Halle, I sing for ya<br />
    A requiem and a Halle Hallelujah<br />
    To light up the dark<br />
    Uuuuuh uuuh uuuh uuuh<br />
    <br />
    I heard the news about how she was found<br />
    'bout a man who pulled the trigger and<br />
    fell to the ground<br />
    Another one walked into the river<br />
    And got swept along<br />
    Life can be short<br />
    But melody lives on<br />
    <br />
    I sing a<br />
    Requiem and a Halle Hallelujah<br />
    A requiem and a Halle, I sing for ya<br />
    A requiem and a Halle Hallelujah<br />
    Until they are<br />
    <br />
    Touching the sky<br />
    The higher they fly<br />
    Touching you<br />
    Take them to paradise<br />
    <br />
    Requiem and a Halle Hallelujah<br />
    Requiem and a Halle, I sing for ya<br />
    Requiem and a Halle Hallelujah<br />

      There’s new wind in<br /> 
      the sail of the schooner<br />
      For now I go, one day I’ll stay<br />
      Come meet me at the bay<br />
      Maybe june or maybe december<br />
      I’ll love again<br />
      <br />
      But now I wonder<br />
      But now I wonder, I say<br />
      <br />
      Hey, how do you do it<br />
      How do you love<br />
      You look like someone<br /> 
      who knew it<br />
      And I say<br />
      <br />
      Hey, how do you do it<br />
      How do you love, how do you love<br />
      Hey, hey, how do you love<br />
      Hey, how do you love<br />
      Hey, hey, how do you love,<br />
      hey, how do you love<br />
      <br />
      One hundred heartbreaks and counting,<br /> 
      a single kiss... you save me from drowning<br />
      That’s how you love<br />
      That’s how you love<br />
      <br />
      Hey, how do you do it, how do you love<br />
      You look at someone who blew it, I say<br />
      Hey, how do you do it,<br /> 
      how do you love, how do you love<br />
      Hey, hey, how do you love,<br /> 
      hey, hey, how do you love,<br />
      Hey, hey, how do you love,<br />
      hey, hey, how do you love<br />

      Did you take a wrong turn to pass me by<br />
      Or did you mean to walk past and catch my eye<br />
      ’Cause you were acting kinda shy<br />
      Then I took a chance and asked you out<br />
      For a month<br />
      We circled roundabouts<br />
      I was falling faster<br />
      Than the speed of light<br />
      <br />
      So last night when I saw you out<br />
      In another man’s arms<br />
      It cut like a knife<br />
      <br />
      Now I’m standing here alone<br />
      On the street where we first met<br />
      I’m falling deeper tryin’ to get you out of my head<br />
      Staring at my phone<br />
      Hoping someday you’ll call it<br />
      I only knew I loved you when I watched you go<br />
      <br />
      Looking back I wonder did I try<br />
      Try enough or was I petrified<br />
      To say what was running through my mind?<br />
      It ain’t easy acting like I’m fine<br />
      Yeah, it tears me up he’s holding you tonight<br />
      Did I let you pass me by<br />
      <br />
      ’Cause that night when I saw you out<br />
      In another man’s arms<br />
      It cut like a knife<br />
      <br />
      Now I’m standing here alone<br />
      On the street where we first met<br />
      I’m falling deeper tryin’ to get you out of my head<br />
      Staring at my phone<br />
      Hoping someday you’ll call it<br />
      I only knew I loved you when I watched you go<br />
      <br />
      I only knew I loved you when I watched you go<br />
      <br />
      Wasn’t easy acting like I was fine<br />
      For a year it tore me up inside<br />
      But I still think of you sometimes<br />
      <br />
      Now I’m standing here alone<br />
      On the street where we first met<br />
      I’m falling deeper tryin’ to get you out of my head<br />
      Staring at my phone<br />
      Hoping someday you’ll call it<br />

      Long ago, little child,<br />
      „You do what you’re told!“<br />
      Daddy tamed you too wild,<br />
      So act like you’re old!<br />
      Then mommy had to go and<br /> 
      you had to star the show<br />
      And almost buried your fire<br />

      Awa-awake, awake my inner child<br />
      Awa-awake and bring me back to life<br />
      Awa-awake, awake my inner child<br /> 
      (awake, awake, awake)<br />
      Awa-awake and let me dance in the wild<br /> 
      (awake, awake, awake)<br />
      <br />
      All alone in the dark,<br />
      No one heard you cry<br />
      Holding on to your spark<br />
      And hoping for light<br />
      But those years are long ago<br />
      And it’s time to welcome home<br />
      Your new fire<br />

      Run away, old man, run away<br />
      Run away, old man, run away from me<br />
      Run away, old man, run away<br />
      Run away, old man, run away from me<br />
      <br />
      Awa-awake, awake my inner child<br />

      Most of my days I spent life on the road<br />
      Took backroad highways to meet the simple folk<br />
      Nights ran together in a haze of drink and smoke<br />
      So I left with the rising sun, all alone<br />
      <br />
      Go! Go!<br />
      <br />
      Shake away, shake away the old chains in my life<br />
      Got a new, got a new love and open eyes<br />
      Break away, break away the old ways and live high<br />
      Got a new course for the light<br />
      <br />
      Made it out west through the desert and the snow<br />
      How you found me I reckon some day I’ll know<br />
      You picked me up from a depth I couldn’t cope<br />
      And you showed me a life of love, trust and hope<br />
      <br />
      Go!<br />
      <br />
      Shake away, shake away the old chains in my life<br />
      Got a new, got a new love and open eyes<br />
      Break away, break away the old ways and live high<br />
      Got a new course for the light<br />
      <br />
      Oh oh oh oh<br />
      Oh oh oh oh...<br />
      <br />
      Shake away, shake away the old chains in my life<br />
      Got a new, got a new love and open eyes<br />
      Break away, break away the old ways and live high<br />
      Got a new course for the light<br />
      <br />
      Got a new course for the light<br />
      Got a new course for the light<br />

      Roll the stone like Sisyphus<br />
      You said, “Why me? is not the question here”<br />
      “Why not me?” was your answer<br />
      Walking with you head high<br />
      <br />
      Facing the challenge gave you consciousness<br />
      A light that shows where true freedom is<br />
      “It’s hidden in the shadows”<br />
      <br />
      I wish I would have told you<br />
      In case I never showed you<br />
      I just want to tell you<br />
      <br />
      Beautiful soul<br />
      Beautiful soul<br />
      Don’t, don’t, don’t you know<br />
      You’re a beautiful soul<br />
      <br />
      You were changing everything<br />
      Turning the worst into the better thing<br />
      That’s why everyone adores you<br />
      <br />
      But I forgot to tell you<br />
      Maybe no one ever showed you<br />
      Can you hear me when I call you<br />
      <br />
      Beautiful soul<br />
      Beautiful soul<br />
      Don’t, don’t, don’t you know<br />
      You’re a beautiful soul, beautiful soul<br />
      Don’t, don’t, don’t you know<br />
      You’re a beautiful soul<br />
      <br />
      Oh don’t you know you’re a beautiful soul<br />
      Oh roll your stone, roll it beautiful soul<br />
      Oh don’t you know you’re a beautiful soul<br />
      Oh roll your stone, roll your stone<br />
      <br />
      You turned your bitter end so sweet<br />
      With laughter and serenity<br />
      I treasure every memory<br />
      Don’t you know<br />
      <br />
      From the cradle to the grave<br />
      Your breath of life will remain<br />
      You see the world outside the cave<br />
      Don’t you know, you’re a beautiful soul<br />
      <br />
      In memory of AG<br />

      Walking home from the school that she hates<br />
      Her life is so nowhere she swears that some day<br />
      She’ll run away, oh she’ll run away<br />
      <br />
      At first all she saw was his coat on the bridge<br />
      Then followed her eye to the boy on the ledge<br />
      What to say, oh what to say<br />
      <br />
      She’ll never know why she did what she did<br />
      Or what made her give him that lifesaving kiss<br />
      <br />
      The whole world is resting upon the shoulders of<br />
      Little little, little little giants<br />
      The whole world is resting upon the shoulders of<br />

      Six years old no one else was around<br />
      He didn’t think twice the baby would drown<br />
      So he was brave, it was the only way<br />
      <br />
      He’ll never know why he did what he did<br /> 
      And cried as they gave her the lifesaving kiss<br />

      The whole world is resting upon the shoulders of<br />
      Little little, little little giants<br />

      The boy who rescued his family from flames<br />
      Died in the fire that’s how he earned his wings<br />
      The 911 call from a girl only four<br />
      To come help her daddy who lay on the floor<br />
      <br />
      Love isn’t measured by how big you are<br />
      Love can be large in the tiniest hearts<br />
      <br />
      The whole world is resting upon the shoulders of<br />
      Little little, little little giants<br />

      Here lately it’s stormy<br />
      Strong winds are blowing<br />
      You think you’re about to let go<br />
      <br />
      When times are heartbreaking<br />
      Stressful and shaking<br />
      There’s always a high ground and hope<br />
      <br />
      Our colours aren’t the same<br />
      But there’s a promise and a way<br />
      With all the strength we have<br />
      We’ll raise the flag<br />
      <br />
      It will sail against the sky<br />
      Like a beacon in the night<br />
      To lead and guide us back<br />
      We’ll wave the flag<br />
      <br />
      I wave your flag<br />
      I wave your flag<br />
      Fly it high up above me<br />
      So you can find me<br />
      <br />
      Your flag<br />
      I wave your flag<br />
      I know you will find me<br />
      <br />
      I raise it high, high, high<br />
      We’ll raise it high, high, high<br />
      <br />
      No, life won’t be easy<br />
      Differences try us<br />
      But love always lightens the soul<br />
      <br />
      So listen for trumpets<br />
      Announcing the coming<br />
      Of friendship and peace in our homes<br />
      <br />
      There is comfort, there is faith<br />
      And in courage there is grace<br />
      Never let the banner drag<br />
      Let’s wave the flag<br />
      <br />
      I wave your flag<br />
      I wave your flag<br />
      Fly it high up above me<br />
      So you can find me<br />
      <br />
      Your flag<br />
      I wave your flag<br />
      I know you will find me<br />
      <br />
      I wave your flag<br />
      I wave your flag<br />
      Fly it high up above me<br />
      So you can find me<br />
      <br />
      Your flag<br />
      I wave your flag<br />
      I know you will find me<br />
      <br />
      I wave your flag<br />
      I wave your flag<br />
      Fly it high up above me<br />
      So you can find me<br />
      <br />
      Your flag<br />
      I wave your flag<br />
      I know you will find me<br />
      <br />
      I raise it high (high), high, high<br />
      We’ll raise it high (high), high, high<br />
      I raise it high (high), high, high<br />
      We’ll raise it high (high), high, high<br />

      I was wailing with the sirens<br />
      In a noisy world<br />
      Went looking out for silence<br />
      That’s when I left the herd<br />
      <br />
      Running from the enemy<br />
      But the enemy was me<br />
      ‘Til I found the inner chamber<br />
      That echoes eternity ( echoes eternity )<br />
      <br />
      Now I’m resting my head<br />
      Where the stars go to bed<br />
      Light fades back from blue to red<br />
      As night turns back into day<br />
      <br />
      Here and now<br />
      Where it all began<br />
      Here and now<br />
      I can breathe again<br />
      Happiness shouldn’t stay with me<br />
      Happiness needs to be<br />
      <br />
      Here and now<br />
      Where the ocean meets the sky<br />
      Here and now<br />
      I leave it all behind<br />
      Happiness between you and me<br />
      Happiness needs to be, needs to be shared<br />
      <br />
      Now do you see what I see<br />
      And feel what I can feel<br />
      Just scream into the open wild<br />
      Freedom can be real ( freedom can be real )<br />
      <br />
      So rest down your head<br />
      Where the stars go to bed<br />
      Light fades back from blue to red<br />
      As night turns back into day<br />
      <br />
      Here and now<br />
      Where it all began<br />
      Here and now<br />
      I can breathe again<br />
      Happiness shouldn’t stay with me<br />
      Happiness needs to be<br />
      <br />
      Here and now<br />
      Where the ocean meets the sky<br />
      Here and now<br />
      I leave it all behind<br />
      Happiness between you and me<br />
      Happiness needs to be, needs to be shared<br />
      <br />
      Come on come on, come on come on<br />
      Come on come on, come on come on<br />
      <br />
      Oh happiness shouldn’t stay with me<br />
      Happiness needs to be, needs to be shared<br />

      One of those days when you<br /> 
      feel so out of touch<br />
      Even the angel on my shoulder<br /> 
      has had enough<br />
      I feel like a boy against Goliath<br />
      Who’s laughing down at my desires<br />
      All my armour is full of holes,<br /> 
      and full of trust<br />
      <br />
      One of those nights where<br />
      you get no rest at all<br />
      Counting headlights trace<br /> 
      a path across the wall<br />
      Where is the voice that<br /> 
      talks so sweetly<br />
      The only one who can complete me<br />
      Every time I trip into<br /> 
      your arms I fall<br />
      <br />
      ‘Cause with you as my witness<br />
      You make me wanna be a better man<br />
      I’m not afraid of my weakness<br />
      When my faith is like<br /> 
      castles in the sand<br />
      I can be fearless<br />
      You make me believe in a bigger plan<br />
      ‘Cause when I’m with you<br />
      I know that I am in safe hands,<br /> 
      in safe hands<br />
      <br />
      You reach out to me,<br /> 
      you don’t judge and you don’t blame<br />
      If for a second the best of my<br />
      intentions evaporate<br />
      When them demons on my shoulder<br />
      Are getting louder, getting bolder<br />
      With just one touch your love<br />
      blows them all away<br />
      <br />
      ‘Cause with you as my witness<br />
      You make me wanna be a better man<br />
      I’m not afraid of my weakness<br />
      When my faith is like castles in the sand<br />
      I can be fearless<br />
      You make me believe in a bigger plan<br />
      ‘Cause when I’m with you<br />
      I know that I am in safe hands, in safe hands<br />
      <br />
      In safe hands, in safe hands, oh year<br />
      <br />
      Cause with you as my witness<br />
      You make me wanna be a better man<br />
      I’m not afraid of my weakness<br />
      When my faith is like castles in the sand<br />
      I can be fearless<br />
      You make me believe in a bigger plan<br />

      so we must build and ark<br />

      so we went on a pilgrimage searching for<br />
      healing at the heavenly wells<br />
      we came across a wise man telling us<br />
      „children it's very simple, conversation,<br />
      mass the sacraments and...“<br />
      <br />
      Pray, pray pray pray,<br />
      pray pray pray...<br />
      <br />
      Oh we've got to pray, pray pray pray,<br />
      pray pray pray for a happier day<br />
      need a childlike faith to enter into heaven<br />
      'til the harvesters come<br />
      don't be afraid<br />
      <br />
      We all have our crosses to carry<br />
      if we carry them humbly there's<br /> 
      no need to worry<br />
      if we forgive we'll be forgiven<br />
      then our purified hearts will <br />
      feel the presence<br />
      of God's eternal love burn inside<br />
      I ain't no religious expert but I don't have to<br />
      be to know thet God ain't illusion<br />
      I'm testifying what I witness 'cause a faith<br />
      without acts is a dead faith that's why<br />
      I wrote this song so we can<br />
      <br />
      Pray, pray pray pray,<br />
      pray pray pray...<br />
      Oh we've got to pray, pray pray pray,<br />
      pray pray pray for a happier day<br />
      <br />
      Pray pray pray for a happier day<br />
      pray pray pray for a happier day<br />
      <br />
      Got to pray for a better day<br />
      got to pray for a better day<br />

      Saint Theresa little flower<br />
      during your short life on earth<br />
      you became a mirror of angelic purity<br />
      of love as strong as death<br />
      and wholehearted abandonment to God<br />
      now that you rejoice in your reward<br />
      turn your eyes of mercy upon me<br />
      for I so ardently desire<br />
      <br />
      a rain of roses on my head<br />
      a rain of roses at my hour of death<br />
      shower roses on my head<br />
      shower roses at my hour of death<br />
      obtain for me the need to keep<br />
      my heart and mind pure like your own<br />
      to receive the hoped for graces<br />
      from the Lord's infinite Goodness<br />
      I put all my confidence in you<br />
      your Little way has reached me too<br />
      <br />
      yes I implore your intercession<br />
      for I so ardently desire<br />
      a rain of roses on my head<br />
      a rain of roses at my hour of death<br />
      shower roses on my head<br />
      shower roses at my hour of death<br />
      little by little I come to littleness<br />
      little by little to serve and love Him best<br />
      little by little I'm on your Little way<br />
      <br />
      Saint Theresa of the Child Jesus<br />
      oh I so ardently desire<br />

      a rain of roses on my head<br />
      a rain of roses at my hour of death<br />

      Deep down the ocean is where I'm going<br />
      Away from the surface that evil has woven<br />
      Cause believing lies<br />
      Is like eating rotten apples<br />
      Fighting through the jungle<br />
      in this world of wackos<br />
      <br />
      Blown by the wind or taken<br />
      By the current and being hurried<br />
      To be burried is what you inherit<br />
      Grow up with mass media manipulation<br />
      Perverting present and future generations<br />
      <br />
      Gotta be as wise as a snake<br />
      And gentle as a dove<br />
      I'd rather be a manacay than a fake<br />
      As long as I work out of love<br />
      Alive for heaven's sake but<br />
      just believing is not enough<br />

      If I'm not in the solution I'm in the problem<br />
      Just one man's opinion amongst 6 billion<br />
      Politically incorrect even if that nails me dead<br />
      'Cause someone's gotta stop... to break the silence<br />
      <br />
      Gotta be as wise as a snake<br />

      for the given birth date<br />
      while buying clothes and dipers<br />

      a new member in the family<br />
      at the fire they sit<br />
      you're lying in the cribb<br />
      rocked by mom and daddy<br />

      good night, miracle of l ove<br />

      every minute that you live<br />
      is a miracle God gives<br />
      the heavens are delighted<br />

      good night, miracle of love<br />

      you look like an angel to me<br />
      oh when you sleep<br />
      <br />
      our hardened hearts melted like wax<br />
      the day you came into our lives<br />
      enchanted by your laughing cracks<br />
      and very soon you'll be baptised<br />
      <br />

      Such a beautiful site<br />
      entered into my life<br />
      my interest conquered the fright<br />
      to meet the Mother of all light<br />
      my pounding heart rose in speed<br />
      when She planted a seed<br />
      in the deepest essence of me<br />
      it was the day my spirit was freed<br />
      <br />
      oh I'm thanking Blessed Mary<br />
      for light Divine<br />
      thanking Blessed Mary<br />
      for light Divine<br />
      thanking Blessed Mary<br />
      for light<br />
      <br />
      temptation messed me around<br />
      She picked me up from the ground<br />
      and taught me to never let go<br />
      of your God given soul<br />
      but sometimes I still lose my mind<br />
      when life is cruel and unkind<br />
      but it's when I suffer that I learn<br />
      in a repenting heart love will burn<br />
      <br />
      oh I'm thanking Blessed Mary<br />
      for light Divine<br />
      thanking Blessed Mary<br />
      for light Divine<br />
      thanking Blessed Mary<br />
      for light<br />
      <br />
      oh my faith has been renewed<br />
      She guides me to eternal life<br />
      and to the truth<br />
      oh oh oh oh oh<br />
      yes my faith has been renewed<br />
      <br />
      oh I'm thanking Blessed Mary...<br />
      and now I've met Jesus Her Son<br />
      with the Holy Spirit<br />
      I've begun a pilgrimage to heaven above<br />
      to our Father's kingdom of love<br />
      <br />
      ave, ave, ave Maria...<br />

      I denied the truth that was<br /> 
      written in my heart<br />
      I demanded proof before<br /> 
      my faith could really start<br />
      religion has its weaknesses<br />
      when it's runned by man<br />
      and man isn't perfect that<br /> 
      took a while to understand<br />
      <br />
      people places<br />    
      are easily accused<br />
      for weak decisions consciously<br /> 
      or subconsciously choosed<br />
      I ask myself each day what<br /> 
      are the right things to do<br />

      I find you can be nothing if<br /> 
      it's nothing you believe in<br />
      and the consequences of half<br /> 
      truths are deceiving<br />
      I'm in the learning process<br /> 
      of loving my neighbor as myself<br />
      in a state of the art I come to<br /> 
      knowledge of my inner wealth<br />
      <br />
      lies and sin interfere with<br /> 
      my intelligence and will<br />
      and my faith gets tested<br />
      by following nature's laws that<br />
      have been there from the start<br />
      I strive to pridelessness in the heart<br />
      <br />
      I'm on my search for truth...<br />
      <br />
      I denied the truth that was<br /> 
      written in my heart<br />
      it took me a few crucial wacks<br /> 
      efore I could really start<br />
      searching for the meaning and<br /> 
      my mission in this life<br />
      which brought me back to dreams<br /> 
      <br />
      of children with my future wife<br />
      travelling miles to find old values<br /> 
      in this present day<br />
      it's hard to stay on track when<br /> 
      temptation doesn't stay away<br />
      do to others as you would<br /> 
      have them do to you<br />
      that's my motto<br />
      I hope you have one too<br />

      you're a celebrity<br />
      and get invited to all the parties of the VIP's<br />
      it's like swimming in a pool with sharks<br />
      of the M-industry<br />
      oh gosh what have I gotten into<br />
      there's a negative and positive side to money and fame<br />
      and I'd be lieing if I told you I haven't changed,<br />
      I'm the same yet the irony remains<br />
      you can't get used to it or tamed<br />
      so smile when they take your picture<br />
      <br />
      I feel like if I'm in a movie<br />
      I feel like if I'm in a movie<br />
      yeah, yeah, yeah<br />
      I'm in a movie<br />
      yeah, yeah, yeah<br />
      I'm in a movie<br />
      yeah, yeah, I'm in a<br />
      <br />
      well I got a couple awards<br />
      in my studio back home<br />
      my manager and agent constantly on the phone<br />
      but what's the sense of all this if I wake up alone?<br />
      you got the leading part in this big picture<br />
      <br />
      I feel like if I'm in a movie<br />
      I feel like if I'm in a movie<br />
      I feel like if I'm in a movie<br />
      I feel like if I'm in a movie<br />
      yeah, yeah, yeah<br />
      I'm in a movie<br />
      yeah, yeah, yeah<br />
      I'm in a movie,<br />
      movie, movie<br />
      yeah, yeah, yeah<br />
      I'm in a movie, I'm in a<br />

      I remember a state of suicide<br />

      I've come back to my childhood happiness<br />
      The grace of God has filled my emptiness<br />

      There is hope, there is hope for me now<br />
      <br />
      See my generation lost in lies<br />
      Growing up in broken house hold fights<br />
      Hold on, hold on to the voice inside<br />
      Hidden heros don't get televised<br />
      Daily saving their lost brothers life<br />
      Hold on, hold on<br />

      There is hope, there is hope for us all<br />

      No, no I didn't learn, no I didn't learn<br />
      'til my hands got burned<br />
      No we never learn, no we never learn<br />
      Until our fingers burn<br />
      <br />
      There is hope in my soul<br />
      There is hope, there is hope for me now<br />
